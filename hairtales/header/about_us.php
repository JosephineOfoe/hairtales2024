            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Hairtales is an expert beauty rendering establishment with the sole aim 
                of providing the best hair and nail care services to its clients across Ghana. 
                It has offices in Tema, Accra, and Kumasi and has been in operation since April 2018. 
                Our target customers are both men, women and children of all ages who desire to look

        <section id="staff">
            <h2>Staff</h2>
            <p>Hairtales has over twenty staffs in each of its offices which comprises 
                one receptionist/accountant, fifteen hair stylists, one cleaner, two nail technicians 
                and a manager each of whom is a well-trained professional with expert knowledge in all 
                matters of hair and nail care solutions. Our staffs are either full-time or part-time 
                staffs but it is a requirement for the manager to be a full-time staff for very good reasons. 
                Our products and equipment are supplied by both local and foreign brands. For natural hair 
                products, we do our best to use local brands such as Eya Naturals and Adepa Naturals. Whereas, 
                for permed hair and nail products we often import them from UK and USA. Clients are allowed to 
                bring their products if they so wish. We also have influencers like Mariam Owusu Poku, Khanitat 
                Sheriff, and Jasmine Boateng who are in charge of marketing our salon to increase our clientele.</p>

        <section id="operations">
            <h2>Operations</h2>
            <p>We offer services such as hair care, nail care and men's grooming. Our clients can access our 
                services either by walk-ins or bookings. We also handle home services depending on the client's 
                request which comes at a higher fee because of transportation. We are open from Mondays to Saturdays 
                between 9 am to 9 pm. Every first client for each working day gets a 10% discount on their total service 
                cost. Bookings can be made by the clients or by calling our offices. Our salon does not run on credit 
                hence all services must be paid for right after completion to the receptionist. Staffs keep whatever tip 
                they receive from clients without accounting for it and lastly, the manager is the only one responsible for 
                closing the salon.</p>
